In this regard, Alt-i partnered with Microsoft to localise Microsoft Windows and Office Suite for Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba. Before Alt-i, he worked at Innovative Computing Group (ICG) Inc. Ohio, USA, applying Cellular Automata Transform (CAT), an innovative data modelling technology developed in ICG for the perceptual compression of Digital Audio. He taught Artificial Intelligence and Automated Reasoning at the University of Lagos from 2008 to 2019 and has been teaching same subjects in the University of Ibadan from 1990 till date. In 2016 he was commissioned by Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo) to undertake Stake-Holder Consultations and Needs Assessment for the delivery of ICT Centres to some Nigerian universities as part of SNEPCo’s Corporate Social Responsibility programme. He also coordinated the development of curricular and course materials for the M.SC and Ph.D programmes in Artificial Intelligence for the National Open University of Nigeria (NOUN). As a consulting Broadcast Engineer and Media Systems Integrator, he helped to develop the technology infrastructure for the Nigerian Motion Picture Industry (Nollywood), working with production houses such as Mainframe Productions, Klink Studios, Cinecraft and Media International. He designed and installed many of the pioneering private TV Stations in Nigeria including Channels Television, MITV and Africa Independent Television (AIT), which he designed, supplied, installed and commissioned between 1995 and 1997.

Under this very generic title I will summarize some work in our group related to embeddings, machine translation and evaluation that has been done for languages from Sub-Saharan Africa. I will start by defining a low-resource setting and we will see how, in this case, the (language-dependent) curation of the data is crucial for some tasks. Afterwards I will focus on neural machine translation (NMT) and compare several approaches when only a limited amount of parallel data is available. Using one of the models as example, self-supervised NMT, we will discuss the evaluation of such models to see that, in low-resource settings, not only trainings but also evaluations are a challenge.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"64080d28c2ce14c300a797c0189baa36","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Bio Cristina España-Bonet is currently the machine translation team lead at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI GmbH).

BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"a9aa9970831e8ec9eb589b6b61b46f1c","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Bio Timnit Gebru is the founder and executive director of the Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (DAIR).
